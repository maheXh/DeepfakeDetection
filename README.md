## Deepfake Detection Web Dashboard

### Overview

Welcome to our Deepfake Detection Web Dashboard – a powerful tool designed to analyze uploaded videos using a meticulously curated list of tested and verified deepfake detectors. Each detector in our arsenal utilizes distinct techniques, bringing its own strengths and weaknesses to the table. The results from these detectors are then intelligently aggregated by an ensemble model, finely tuned based on their historical performance, as observed through a meticulously prepared custom dataset.

### Key Features

#### Multiple Detectors Integration

Our web dashboard is designed with adaptability in mind. It seamlessly integrates new detectors, ensuring that the system can evolve and stay ahead of emerging deepfake techniques.

#### Parallel Processing

Addressing the computational challenges, we employ Intel oneAPI and optimized libraries to implement parallel processing. This not only enhances the overall efficiency but also significantly reduces the time required for individual model processing.

#### Detector Methods

We've modularized the detector functionalities into two distinct methods:

- Video Preprocessing: Converts uploaded videos into tensors for analysis.
  
- Inference: Applies deepfake detection algorithms to the preprocessed tensors, yielding probabilities for each video.

#### Code Reusability

Our approach includes a smart split within detectors, allowing for efficient code reuse. The same preprocessing can be applied to multiple detectors, optimizing the use of shared functionalities.

#### Face Recognition

To expedite the preprocessing phase, we leverage the MediaPipe library for face detection and cropping. This further accelerates the overall processing speed, enhancing user experience.

#### Multi-face Handling

For videos containing multiple faces, we present various faces to the user, who can then choose the face on which the detection needs to be performed. This ensures compatibility with algorithms trained for individual faces.

### Probability Aggregation

#### Ensemble Model

We've developed and trained an AI model to intelligently aggregate probabilities from individual detectors. This provides users with a comprehensive overview, taking into account the unique strengths and weaknesses of each detector.

#### Historical Performance Training

Our ensemble model's training is grounded in historical performance data obtained from datasets such as DFDC, CelebDF, Face Forensic++, etc. This approach aims to address individual detector idiosyncrasies and enhance overall accuracy.

#### Visual Presentation

The dashboard visually presents individual detector probabilities and the aggregated probability through intuitive graphical representation, ensuring user-friendly interpretation.

### Human-in-Loop System

- Enables expert analysis of stored video inputs and outputs, facilitating ongoing model performance improvement.
  
- This system aids in the maintenance of the model, allowing for continuous analysis and enhancement based on real-world data.
  
- Historic performance data for new models can be efficiently generated by utilizing the models to predict outputs from a custom dataset.

### Conclusion

Our Deepfake Detection Web Dashboard stands as a robust and adaptable solution in the fight against the proliferation of deepfake content. By leveraging parallel processing, code reusability, and ensemble models, it offers a comprehensive tool for users. The inclusion of a Human-in-Loop system ensures ongoing improvement and adaptation to emerging challenges in the realm of deepfake detection.
